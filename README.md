# Nueromorphic-Architecture-Project
SRAM in-situ computational accelerator provides massive compute capability with high memory bandwidth. Modified the SRAM architecture to accommodate in-situ multiplication operations. Designed a hierarchical memory architecture with SRAM and eDRAM to address the memory limitation caused due to the area overhead of SRAM.
